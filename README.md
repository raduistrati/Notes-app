# Notes-app
Portfolio project made by me during "Hacking With Swift" iOS App development course.</br>
Course: https://www.hackingwithswift.com</br>
Mentor: Paul Hudson

This is a simple application that copies the standard Apple Notes app.

It saves user notes in UserDefaults and uses Codable to code and decode data.
